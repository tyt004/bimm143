Create fucntion with working snippets
```{r}
#Protein_plot function takes a protein file from PDB and creates a plot of its Bfactor vs Residue. This analysis will help us understand proteins's interactions.

library(bio3d)# download r package
protein_plot<- function (x){ #input is x = protein file name
  z<-read.pdb(x) #reads protein data bank file
z.chainA<-trim.pdb(z, chain="A", elety="CA")#trims the pdb
z.b<-z.chainA$atom$b #selects data
plotb3(z.b, sse=z.chainA, typ="l", ylab="Bfactor")#plots data as a scatterplot with a line. The ouput is a scatter plot of Bfactor vs Residue
}
```

Test the function to see if they produce the same results as orginal script
```{r}
protein_plot("4AKE") #How to use: type out function, insert protein file name, and execute script
protein_plot("1AKE")
protein_plot("1E4Y")
```
